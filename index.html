                    Growing up in a Christian household I learned how to cooperate and understand people.
                    I learned to stay humble and take everyone's input into consideration. I am overall a 
                    sensitive person. I also play alot of sports growing up and it helped me develop communication Skills
                    and teamwork. 
                    which leads to my biggest strength is that I am huge team player. I prefer helping to bring the
                    whole team up, rather than treating it as a competition. I would say my biggest
                    weakness is my lack of overall work experience. However I am willing to be trained 
                    in this company to be a more qualified and efficient employee.
